## Cosine Similarity using Excel
What is Cosine Similarity? Cosine similarity is a metric, helpful in determining, how similar the data objects are irrespective of their size. In cosine similarity, data objects in a dataset are treated as a vector. This is the formula of Cosine Similarity:

So here's the excel file that I have practiced the cosine similarity:

## RFM Analysis using Excel
How to increase sales by analyzing customer behaviour? yes, you can use RFM to check your customer behavior.
The “RFM” in RFM analysis stands for recency, frequency and monetary value. RFM analysis is a way to use data based on existing customer behavior to predict how a new customer is likely to act in the future. An RFM model is built using three key factors:
1. how recently a customer has transacted with a brand
2. how frequently they’ve engaged with a brand
3. how much money they’ve spent on a brand’s products and services.

So here's the excel file that I have practiced the RFM:

## Clustering K-means using Excel
So here's the excel file that I have practiced K-means using Excel: [KmeansClusterAnalysis.xlsx](https://github.com/elizulkatri/dataAnalysis_withExcel/files/9703239/KmeansClusterAnalysis.xlsx)
